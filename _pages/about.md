I am now an algorithm engineer. In June of 2023, I completed my postgraduate studies, receiving a Master of Engineering degree in Control Science and Engineering from the School of Automation Engineering at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), CHN, under the mentorship of Professor [Zhou Xue](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37656687100).
